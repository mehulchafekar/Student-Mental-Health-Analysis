# Student-Mental-Health-Analysis
A Python-based data analysis project exploring factors affecting student mental stress. Includes EDA, data visualization, and actionable insights.

# Overview
This project analyzes factors affecting student mental stress, including academic performance, financial conditions, and family support. Using Python, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and created visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support mental health awareness and academic success.

# Key Features
